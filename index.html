        <h3 id = Life>About My Life</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I was born in Chicago, IL:
        the greatest city known to man. At least that's what people
        who live there tend to think. If it isn't obvious, I don't think the same.
        Perhaps that is because I don't still live in the city. I moved to a suburb
        when I was two. My parents couldn't take it! Or something like that. Actually,
        I probably just made that up. </p>
        
        <p> Anyway, when I was a kid I wanted to be the president and change the way
        our government worked. Then, I wanted to be a librarian, but I didn't stick with that
        since everyone told me, "Briana, you aren't going to make any money!". As if they
        were going to be living off my salary! Then, I wanted to be a teacher and a
        dancer and a musician. Then there was the time I wanted to be a 
    <b>
    	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER 
   </b> 
   		:I know it sounds fancy, I even went to school for it at Washington University in St. Louis
        but, I dropped out: of the major, NOT THE SCHOOL! 
         </p>
         
         <p>Now, I don't know what I want to be. I'm trying out mechanical enginenering and perhaps a minor
         in computer science, but all is unclear. The only things that I am 100 percent sure I want to do in this
         life are (1) become a nomad. <em> YES, A NOMAD!</em> At least in the traveing and lying my head wherever the wind
         takes me sense. (2) Retire and own a ranch in Wyoming where childen can ride the horses and have fun! (3) Help people
         (4) Reach Nirvana. This goal would mean letting go of all my other expectations in life. (Pssssst: I mean the other 
         three goals in this list. Okay, only two of the three things. I'll give you a hint: one of the goals I'll keep isn't number 
         three in the list. HaHaHa</p> 
         
         <p> Insert final paragraph of life here ......... 
         <br />
         <br />
         <br />
         <br />
         <br />
         
         I don't know what will happen at the end of my life. On my final day, I will fill in this paragraph. Until then,
         I hope you have a great day and many reasons to smile!
