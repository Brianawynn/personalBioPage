        <h3>About My Life</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I was born in Chicago, IL:
        the greatest city known to man. At least that's what people
        who live there tend to think. If it isn't obvious, I don't think the same.
        Perhaps that is because I don't still live in the city. I moved to a suburb
        when I was two. My parents couldn't take it! Or something like that. Actually,
        I probably just made that up. </p>
        
        <p> Anyway, when I was a kid I wanted to be the president and change the way
        our government worked. Then I wanted to be a librarian, but everyone told
        me that I couldn't do that because I wouldn't make enough money. As if they
        were going to be living off my salary! Then I wanted to be a teacher and a
        dancer, and a musician. Then there was the time I wanted to be a 
    <em>
    	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER 
   </em> 
   		I even went to school for it at Washington University of St. Louis
        but, I dropped out: of the major, NOT THE SCHOOL!
